# Config
The per-user global configuration written by `/setup` (gitignored). `system/config.example.md` is the committed example.

`run_window` is the window for Work Orders queued with `--window`, as `HH:MM-HH:MM`; empty (the default) or `00:00-24:00` means always. `order_max_five_hour` is the 5-hour usage fraction at or above which no new Work Order starts.

`handoffs_site` (the Jira site's host name) and `handoffs_projects` (Jira project keys) turn on the brief's Handoffs to chase (delivered work spec §3.1); it stays off while `handoffs_projects` is empty.

`triage_enabled` turns on inbox triage on a standalone machine or a server (inbox triage spec): every 30 minutes on workdays, mail that needs the owner becomes an `owed` line on the Now page of `triage_partition` (default `work`).

`nightshift_workspace` and `nightshift_window` are the old names of `order_workspace` and `run_window`. They are still read when the new key is absent; the new key wins when both are set.
