# The Foundry

An Obsidian + Claude Code "second brain" vault template. This file is its manual. A vault's own `README.md` describes that vault (its machines, codebases and what runs where), and template updates never change it (see [Updating and uninstalling](#updating-and-uninstalling)).

> **Status:** in daily use since 2026-10-05 on one Debian server and a laptop client. The headless brief, debrief and intake pipeline passed live acceptance ([record](docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-10-02-plan-4a-acceptance.md)), as did memory capture and recall ([record](docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-10-02-plan-3-acceptance.md)), two-machine sync ([record](docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-10-04-plan-8c-acceptance.md)) and meetings ([record](docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-10-06-plan-11-acceptance.md)). Preferences, style lint and the Foreman orchestrator are still to come (see [Status](#status)).

## What The Foundry is

The Foundry is a template repository that becomes your vault. You clone it (or create a repo from it), run `claude` inside it, and run `/setup`. Setup configures the vault for your machine, your schedule and your codebases. Nothing specific to a machine or a user is committed. Per-user state is generated at setup time and gitignored.

The vault compiles itself. Raw inputs (files you drop in, plus short digests of your Claude Code sessions) are compiled in batches into a wiki of concepts, entities, summaries and preferences. The wiki is split into `work`, `personal` and `shared` partitions, and links are not allowed to cross between `work` and `personal`. A derived SQLite FTS5 index lets agents ask the index for the notes they need before reading anything, so a lookup reads only the notes that answer it rather than the whole wiki.

Agents follow the writing rules in `CLAUDE.md`: chat replies are sized by type (quick answer, one-screen task report, or a linked document), and notes avoid common AI writing tells. The headless intake, brief and debrief runs edit their own prose against the vendored [humanizer](#acknowledgements) skill before they publish, and `/humanizer` runs it interactively.

Automation runs on systemd user timers: isolated headless `claude -p` jobs for intake, a morning brief and an evening debrief, plus a scripted git sync on a server. Headless jobs never write to the vault directly. They write to a staging area, and a deterministic gate validates and publishes their output. Anything that has to be exact (parsing, validation, indexing, unit rendering, git remote handling) is done by a script. The model handles conversation and synthesis.

## Status

**Works today:**
- Headless intake, morning brief and evening debrief, published through a deterministic gate
- Memory: session digest capture and bounded recall (optional hooks)
- Two machines: a server runs the automation and syncs through a private `origin`; clients read and edit in Obsidian
- Calendar input to the brief from the Google Calendar connector
- Error telemetry from Sentry and Azure Data Explorer
- Meetings: Gemini notes and dropped transcripts become meeting notes, tracked actions and searchable transcripts
- Work Orders: queued plans and research briefs run unattended
- DTCC change watcher (phase 1)
- Active Projects in the brief, and an archive of past briefings

**Next:** RCA-to-Jira (phase 1), preference notes from `/ingest`, then the Foreman orchestrator (Sub-project 2). Preferences (Plan 5) and style lint (Plan 7) wait for a few weeks of real use.

- Roadmap, with every plan, its records and its status: [docs/superpowers/roadmap.md](docs/superpowers/roadmap.md)
- Design spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-vault-template-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-vault-template-design.md)

## How it works

The intended loop is **capture → compile → index → recall → correct**:

1. **Capture.** Files you drop in go to `raw/inbox/`, and meeting transcripts to `meetings/drop/<partition>/` (a server with `meetings_enabled` also fetches Gemini notes from Google Drive); each meeting becomes a meeting note with tracked action items and a searchable transcript. Once the memory hooks are installed, sessions in the vault and in registered codebases also leave short, redacted session digests in `raw/<partition>/notes/` (see [Memory](#memory) below).
2. **Compile.** The intake timer batches up to 5 inputs from one partition into an isolated headless `/ingest` run. For each fact, the run records an explicit noop, patch or create decision and writes its output to `wiki/.staging/<run_id>/`.
3. **Publish.** The publish gate validates schemas and partition walls and rejects changes that shrink existing notes. It also checks each target against a snapshot taken at the start of the run. If every check passes, it publishes everything at once. If any check fails, it publishes nothing and the run is quarantined. If you edited a note while the run was going, your edit is kept.
4. **Index.** Markdown is the source of truth. `system/index.db` is a gitignored SQLite FTS5 index that can be rebuilt at any time. Agents run `related`, `query`, `show` and `backlinks` against it before reading any notes.
5. **Recall.** With the memory hooks installed, a `SessionStart` hook adds up to `recall_budget_chars` of vault data (default 9,000 characters, never more than 9,500) to new sessions in scope: the latest digests for the codebase or partition and, once enabled, preferences you have confirmed. Recalled text is marked as data, not instructions.
6. **Correct.** Each digest has a Corrections section. Ingest turns these into `preference` notes with linked evidence. A preference's status is calculated in the index, and it becomes confirmed only after you accept it in `/brief`.

**History.** `/backup` first commits each headless run that published files, one commit per run, with a message `commit_runs.py` builds from the run's records (no model writes it). Each carries `Foundry-Command`, `Foundry-Run` and `Foundry-Role` trailers, so `git log` reads as a handoff log: `git log --grep 'Foundry-Command: ingest'` lists the ingest runs.

| Name | Role | Concrete artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| **The Foundry** | The vault / product | this repo, `foundry-*` systemd units |
| **The Foreman** | The only role you address: briefings, debriefs and the agenda; the orchestrator in Sub-project 2 | `system/agents/foreman.md`, `/brief`, `/debrief` |
| **Workcells** | Specialist agents, each dispatched by the capabilities it lists | `system/agents/workcells/*.md` (each lists its `capabilities`), `capability` on concept notes |
| **The Core** | The compiled wiki, the index and memory | `wiki/`, plus the index and memory rows below |
| index | Search and views over the wiki | `system/index.db`, `vault_index.py` |
| memory | Session digest capture and recall | `system/hooks/memory_*.sh`, `/digest`, `vault_index.py recall` |
| intake compiler | Headless compile of raw inputs | `foundry-intake.service`/`.timer`, `intake_daemon.sh`, `run_headless.sh ingest` |
| publish gate | Validate, conflict-check, publish | `publish_staged.py`, `vaultlib/publish.py` |
| watcher | Zero-token watcher of Workcell sessions (reserved, Sub-project 2) | `foundry-watcher.service` (reserved) |
| Workcell sessions | Ship and scout sessions of a Workcell (reserved, Sub-project 2); scout reports land in `raw/inbox/` | `system/jobs/` (reserved), `FOUNDRY_WORKCELL_SESSION` |
| Production Job, Work Order | A multi-step assignment and each of its tasks (Sub-project 2) | `FOUNDRY_WORK_ORDER`, the digest field `work_order` |

Script and module filenames stay descriptive so they are easy to grep. Unit `Description=` lines read `The Foundry: <role>`, and log and alert tags use plain names (`[intake]`, `[memory]`, `[sync]`).

## Daily use

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/brief [date]` | The Foreman writes `briefings/<date>.md`: calendar commitments, the open lines of your Now pages (From Now), 🎯 Active Projects, 🧾 Handoffs to chase when handoffs are set up, and a friction matrix. It adds 3–5 objectives tied to your superpowers and handed to a capability, and any new DTCC changes, to the Now pages. A 📝 Notes section holds your own notes for the day; `/brief` never edits it. Briefings and debriefs from before yesterday move to `briefings/archive/<YYYY-MM>/` |
| `/debrief [date]` | The Foreman writes `briefings/<date>.debrief.md` (embedded in the briefing): commits per repo, digest outcomes, headless runs, alerts, focus, agent health and what you delivered today |
| `/ingest <raw file>` | Compiles one raw input into `wiki/`; the intake timer runs it headless in batches |
| `/query <question>` | Answers from compiled `wiki/` notes only, through the index |
| `/lint` | Integrity report plus link, duplicate, contradiction and staleness suggestions |
| `/impact <component> [--repo name]` | Read-only blast-radius table across registered codebases and the wiki; offers to draft an intent proposal |
| `/backup` | Runs the gating suites (lint only on a client), commits each headless run on its own, then commits and pushes the rest according to `remote_mode` (through `vault_sync.sh` in `private`) |
| `/order add\|ask\|list\|cancel\|status` | Queues an approved plan (or a task range of one) or a research brief as a Work Order for an unattended run; lists, cancels and reports on queued Work Orders |
| `/dtcc-watch [check\|status\|accept]` | Runs the DTCC change watcher by hand, checks its map, reports recent changes, or accepts held changes as the new baseline |
| `/setup` | Onboarding; safe to re-run |
| `/humanizer`, `/digest` | Edit prose against the vendored skill; write a session digest on demand |

**Superpowers** are your strategic anchors, set in `system/config.md` (`superpowers:`). The brief ties each objective to one, and onboarding and intent notes name the ones they serve. They are unrelated to the superpowers Claude Code plugin used in [Development](#development).

**Brief inputs.** The calendar (`calendar.tsv`, from the Google Calendar connector), today's and yesterday's alerts, production-error groups in `raw/telemetry/` (new, recurring and resolved in the last 24 hours, per environment), friction notes (`is_friction` on concepts), quarantined inputs, yesterday's focus, and mail and chat when a Gmail or Slack connector is present in an interactive session. Missing sources are listed under Unavailable Sources; the brief never fails for one.

**Error telemetry.** `foundry-telemetry.timer` runs `telemetry_fetch.py` every hour, and `brief_prep.sh` runs it once more before the brief. Each source in `system/telemetry/<name>.md` (written by `/setup` phase 6a, gitignored) is a set of Sentry projects or one Azure Data Explorer database with a filter. An empty filter value (`adx_filter: {deployment.instance: ""}`) selects the rows that lack that attribute, so shared services that log without it get a source of their own. A filter on one value and an empty filter on the same key never select the same row; a source with no filter (`{}`) overlaps both and counts their groups twice. Each error group becomes one `production_error` note in `raw/telemetry/` holding group keys, counts, times, opaque IDs, links and the Sentry issue title or one sample log message, ticket identifiers included; credentials and emails are masked. Sentry needs a read-only token in `~/.config/foundry/sentry.token` (mode 0600); ADX uses your `az login`. `--check <name>` tests a source, `--dry-run` prints the groups without writing.

**Work Orders.** `/order` queues refined work for an unattended run: an approved plan, or a task range of one, or a research brief written with you. Queuing is your approval, and a readiness check refuses items that are not refined enough. `foundry-nightshift.timer` ticks every 15 minutes on a standalone machine or a server (never a client) and runs one due item at a time. A Work Order starts now unless it was queued for a set time (`--at`) or for the run window (`--window`, the `run_window` setting). By default `run_window` is empty and the window is always open; a vault that sets one, such as `22:00-05:00`, keeps it. Before this update the window defaulted to `22:00-05:00`: if you relied on that, set `run_window: "22:00-05:00"` before updating, or Work Orders already queued for the window start at the next tick. No new Work Order starts while the last session's 5-hour usage is at or above `order_max_five_hour` (default `0.6`) and that reading is under 5 hours old; a running one carries on, and `/order status` shows the hold. Design sessions (brainstorm, spec, plan) hand an approved plan to the Foreman session, which queues it with `/order add`. Run the Foreman session and your design sessions in the same permission mode, so a handoff is not held for approval. A plan item runs in a private clone under `order_workspace`, is verified, pushed to a branch and ends in a pull request; it never merges or deploys. A research item reads its sources and writes one findings note. Each item runs in a fresh, confined `claude -p` session that holds no credential. The report, `system/logs/nightshift/<date>.md` (heading `# Work Orders: <date>`), starts with a health banner, then "Needs you" (decisions only), which the brief adds to the Now page. Queue notes live in `raw/<partition>/nightshift/`, tracked in your vault so an item queued on a client reaches the server. A plan item for this template is read from `template_remote`: push its branch there before queuing it, and queuing checks the remote, which needs the network and the remote's credentials. Settings renamed with Work Orders: `run_window` was `nightshift_window`, `order_workspace` was `nightshift_workspace`, and a codebase's `order_pr`, `order_hosts` and `order_plugins` were `nightshift_pr`, `nightshift_hosts` and `nightshift_plugins`. The old names still work; rename them when convenient. The command, the skill and printed text say Work Orders; files, units, the queue folders and `nightshift.py` keep their names.

**DTCC change watcher.** It is for a codebase that integrates with DTCC Insurance & Retirement Services. `foundry-dtcc-watch.timer` runs `dtcc_watch.py` daily, 30 minutes before the brief. No model runs. It reads DTCC's public product pages, release dates, Important Notices and API catalog, and writes one `dtcc_change` note per change to `wiki/<partition>/changes/` with the codebase paths it touches. The brief adds each change to the Now page as an `owed` line, which stays until you tick it. The watcher does nothing until your vault has `system/dtcc/map.yaml` (start from `system/dtcc/map.example.yaml`).

**The Now page.** `wiki/<partition>/Now.md` is one checklist per partition of open loops: what you owe (`owed`), what you wait on (`waiting`) and messages not yet sent (`draft`). Each line is `- [ ] <kind>: <statement> (<who>, since <date>[, <evidence>])`. Sessions add lines with `system/scripts/now.py add`, and the brief adds its new objectives, DTCC changes and Work Order decisions. The brief's **From Now** block is a Dataview query over both pages: tick a line there (`[x]` done, `[-]` dropped) and the tick lands on the Now page. Every 5 minutes on a standalone machine or a server, the intake timer runs `now.py check`: a line whose evidence is a GitHub pull request that merged or closed, or a Work Order that is done, failed or cancelled, is ticked with `_(closed: <how> <date>)_`. A line you tick gets `_(closed: ticked <date>)_`, and closed lines leave the page 7 days later. Session recall shows the session partition's open lines first. The first brief after this update creates your default partition's page from the previous brief's open objectives.

**Active Projects.** An optional `wiki/<partition>/ActiveProjects.md` lists your project pages in priority order under `## Active`. Each morning, `active_projects.py` reads those pages, and the brief shows each project's next 3 open checkboxes and the open items under its "Decisions…" heading, as plain bullets. You tick items on the project page, so nothing is tracked twice.

**Meetings fetch: retrying a skipped Doc.** After three failed reads of one Gemini Doc (any non-zero exit, timeouts and usage limits included), the fetch alerts once ("`<id>` failed 3 reads; it is skipped from now on") and skips it, because it counts failures in this month's and last month's `system/logs/meetings_fetch-<YYYY-MM>.jsonl`. To fetch it again: delete that Doc's `"step": "read"` lines from those two log files, then set `system/logs/meetings_fetch.since` to a time before the Doc was created (ISO 8601, UTC), so the next run's search window includes it. The next fetch reads it once more; the `.since` file moves forward again on success. (#44)

**Debrief inputs.** The prep files in `system/logs/inputs/<date>/` (git commits, session digests, focus, and `orders.md`, the open Work Orders report), alerts, the run ledger `system/logs/runs-<YYYY-MM>.jsonl`, the telemetry run log `system/logs/telemetry-<YYYY-MM>.jsonl`, and agent metrics in `system/logs/metrics/*.json`. An agent whose 3 most recent metric files all show `test_suite_passed: false` is reported under Agent Health; the debrief does not act on it.

**Handoffs and delivered work.** With `handoffs_site` and `handoffs_projects` set (`/setup` phase 6c), each brief runs `jira_fetch.sh`: a confined `claude -p` session that may call only the Atlassian connector's JQL search, with a query built from those settings. It lists under 🧾 Handoffs to chase the tickets you reported that someone else holds and that have had no status-category change for 7 days (the connector returns no change history, so a move inside one category, such as In Progress to In Review, does not reset the clock). The vault keeps no copy of the tickets. The debrief lists what you delivered under 6. Delivered Today: each digest's Delivered section, `delivered:` lines in the briefing's 📝 Notes (the Foreman adds one when you ask it to log something), and pull requests you opened, merged or reviewed in the registered GitHub repositories (`gh`, logged in; a codebase's `order_pr: github:<owner>/<repo>` and a GitHub `template_remote`).

**Workcells.** Work goes to the Workcell whose `capabilities` include the one the work needs, never by name:

| Workcell | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `coding.md` | `code`, `tests`, `refactor`; writes a `compilation-metric.json` instance to `system/logs/metrics/` after each task |
| `maintenance.md` | `vault-health`, `dependencies`, `telemetry`, `alerts`; owns `raw/telemetry/` notes, which it checks against local branches of the affected codebase |

**Friction and focus.** Ingest sets `is_friction: "true"` when a fact's source text says "not sure", "waiting on", "stuck", "blocked", "tbd" or "double-check". On a standalone machine with Hyprland, `track_obsidian.sh` samples the focused note every 30 seconds and `focus_stats.sh` flags each 15-minute window with more than 4 switches as a Focus Fragmentation Warning, which the brief and debrief carry.

**Intent proposals.** `system/templates/intent-shaper.md` creates a `plan_gate` note (`PENDING_REVIEW`, `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`) for a planned code change: its superpower, the upstream plan note it traces to, the files it touches, how it is verified and its blast radius.

## Memory

Memory is part of The Core. It is optional and off until you install its hooks. `/setup` offers them in its memory step: it shows the change `system/scripts/install_hooks.sh --dry-run` would make to your user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`, explains each entry, and installs only after an explicit yes. Declining leaves memory off; re-run `/setup` to turn it on later.

| Entry | What it does |
|---|---|
| `memory_recall.sh` (`SessionStart`) | Adds recent digests for the codebase or partition to a new session, up to `recall_budget_chars` (default 9,000 characters), marked as vault data, not instructions |
| `memory_capture.sh` (`Stop`) | After enough work (`digest_min_events` tool events and `digest_min_minutes` minutes since the last digest, default 5 and 20), asks for a short digest once, then redacts it and writes it to `raw/<partition>/notes/` |
| `memory_activity.sh` (`PostToolUse`) | Counts edits and Bash calls toward that threshold |
| three `permissions.allow` rules | Let codebase sessions run `vault_index.py related`, `show` and `backlinks`, which return only that codebase's partition plus `shared` |
| `~/.claude/commands/digest.md` | The `/digest` command, written only if you have no `digest.md` of your own |

The hooks run in every Claude Code session on the machine but act only inside the vault and registered codebases. Headless runs, subagents and `claude -p` scripts are skipped.

**"Stop hook error" is not an error.** Claude Code labels every request from a `Stop` hook "Stop hook error:". When the vault asks for a digest, you see `Stop hook error: Foundry memory (not an error): please reply with a short session digest. …`; Claude replies with the digest and the session carries on. The hook never asks twice in a row, and not when Claude's last reply ended with a question to you.

**`/digest`** writes a digest of the work since the last one whenever you want, in any session in scope. The `Stop` hook captures it from the reply; no script or session id is needed.

## Repository layout

The layout, abbreviated from spec §5. `/digest` is not in the repo: it is a user-level command that `install_hooks.sh` writes to `~/.claude/commands/digest.md`, so it works in codebase sessions too.

## Machine roles

Each machine that holds the vault has a `machine_role` in its own `system/config.md`, chosen in `/setup`:

| Role | Runs | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `standalone` (default) | intake, brief, debrief and focus units, and the meetings fetch when enabled; memory hooks; codebases | one machine that does everything |
| `server` | intake, brief, debrief and sync units, and the meetings fetch when enabled; memory hooks; codebases | an always-on machine that runs the automation and your coding sessions |
| `client` | nothing automated | reading and editing the vault in Obsidian on another machine |

A server and its clients share the vault through a private `origin` (`remote_mode: private`):

- **Server.** `vault_sync.sh` runs every `sync_interval_minutes` (`foundry-sync.timer`) and before and after every run: it commits headless runs and other changes with scripted messages, merges `origin` and pushes. Network and credential failures never stop the runs; they are alerted once a day until sync works again.
- **Client.** The Obsidian Git plugin commits and syncs every few minutes; `/setup` prints its settings. Write notes in today's briefing between the `#wiki-ingest-start` and `#wiki-ingest-end` markers already in 📝 Notes: the server sends that block to the wiki once, at 05:00 the next morning, so you can edit it all day and the night's sync can bring your last edits over. A block you mark anywhere else in the briefing is compiled within a few minutes. The briefing stays as it is (on every role, blocks stay in the briefing after compiling). Edits that reach the server after 05:00 the next morning are not sent. Files in `raw/inbox/` on a client are not synced. Meeting transcripts dropped into `meetings/drop/<partition>/` are synced, and the server imports them; move a finished file in (an empty one is quarantined).

### Sync conflicts

A conflict is never resolved automatically. The server aborts the merge, pushes its side to `foundry/server-pending` on `origin`, writes `system/logs/sync-blocked`, alerts once, and skips intake, brief and debrief until it is resolved. Resolve it on the other machine (for `foundry/server-pending`, a client):

```sh
git fetch origin
git merge origin/foundry/server-pending   # a client's own conflict uses origin/foundry/client-pending
# fix the conflicted files, then
git commit
git push
```

On the machine that pushed the pending branch, its side is already checked out: run `git merge origin/<branch>` there instead (`<branch>` is the vault's branch), then resolve, commit and push.

The next server sync clears the marker, deletes the pending branch and starts a brief or debrief that was skipped today.

`wiki/<partition>/Now.md` is the one note both machines write: you tick lines on the client, and the server closes lines on checked evidence. The server rewrites the page only when it closes a line, but a tick on the client next to a line the server just closed can still conflict. Resolve it as above, keeping both changes. The pre-commit hook rejects any file that still holds conflict markers; if a client note that bypassed the hook blocks your commit, the hook names it: fix it, or commit with `--no-verify` knowingly.

## Requirements

The Foundry runs on Arch / Omarchy and on Debian. `system/scripts/check_deps.sh --role <role>` checks what that role needs and prints `pacman` or `apt` install hints:

- `claude` (Claude Code), `git`, `jq`, `bats`, `flock`, `timeout`
- `python3` with PyYAML and pytest (`sudo pacman -S python-yaml python-pytest`). Missing PyYAML blocks setup.
- `sqlite3` built with FTS5
- systemd user units (`systemctl --user`, `systemd-analyze`). If you want timers to run while you are logged out, enable lingering.
- A Google Calendar connector on the Claude account the brief machine is logged in with, for calendar input to the brief. Without it the brief lists the calendar under Unavailable Sources. Each morning fetch costs about $0.20.
- Hyprland (`hyprctl`) for the Obsidian focus tracker, on a standalone machine only. Without it only focus stats are lost.
- A client needs only `claude`, `git`, `jq`, `python3` with PyYAML, and SQLite with FTS5.
- Optional: the Azure CLI (`az`, logged in) for ADX error sources, and a read-only Sentry token for Sentry sources. Without them those sources stay off.
- Optional: `pdftotext` (`poppler` on Arch, `poppler-utils` on Debian) for the DTCC change watcher, which reads the header of each notice's PDF.
- Optional: `herdr` or `tmux` as session backends for sub-project 2
- Obsidian, with the **Dataview** plugin recommended (`wiki/Index.md` dashboards are plain code blocks without it). **[Vault Curate](https://github.com/notoriouslab/vault-curate)** is an optional plugin for link suggestions. It is not a dependency.

## Getting started

Before you start, install what [Requirements](#requirements) lists and sign in to Claude Code (`claude`, then `/login`). For a server or a client, also create an **empty private repository** for your vault on your git host (no README, license or `.gitignore`, so it has no commit of its own to reconcile): that is your private `origin`, and every machine syncs through it.

**First machine (standalone or server).** Clone the template, start Claude Code in it, and paste the prompt below with your answers filled in:

```sh
git clone <template-url> my-vault    # or "Use this template" on the hosting site
cd my-vault
claude
```

**A client.** Set up the first machine first. Then clone your private vault (not the template) and paste the same prompt with `client` as the role:

```sh
git clone <private origin> my-vault
cd my-vault
claude
```

The prompt (replace every `<…>` first; `/setup` asks for any answer still written as `<…>`):

```text
Set up this clone as a new Foundry vault. Run /setup and use these answers; ask me only for what is missing:
- Machine role: <standalone | server | client>
- Timezone: <Area/City>; brief at <HH:MM>; debrief at <HH:MM>
- Default partition: <work | personal>
- Remote: private, origin <private origin URL>   (or: none, standalone only)
- Codebases to register: <paths, or none>          (not used on a client)
- Memory hooks: <yes | no>                         (not used on a client)
Never push to the template repository. Before installing units or memory hooks,
show me what will change and wait for my yes. Run any command that needs sudo
(linger) only by giving it to me. When you finish, show the /setup report table
and list what I still have to do by hand.
```

You can also type `/setup` and answer its questions one at a time; the prompt only gives it the answers up front. On a server, `/setup` stops at the units phase until linger is on (`sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`, which you run yourself). On a client it ends with the Obsidian Git settings to enter and asks you to make one test edit.

`/setup` is idempotent and can be re-run at any time. Its phases (spec §11):

- **0. Role and preflight:** you choose the machine role, then `check_deps.sh --role <role>` lists missing items with install hints. A client skips phases 3, 6 and 9; on a client, phases 5 and 5a only remove units and hooks left from an earlier role.
- **1. Existing config:** if `system/config.md` already exists, it is shown and edited, not overwritten.
- **2. Interview:** timezone, brief and debrief times, superpowers, default partition, digest thresholds and recall budget.
- **3. Codebases:** you choose repos from a directory scan. Each one is inspected, written to `system/codebases/<name>.md` with a partition, and confirmed with you field by field.
- **4. Remote:** the template `origin` of a plain clone is renamed `template` for updates, and you choose a private `origin`, no remote, or keep (maintainer mode). A server or client must use a private `origin`; setup checks that git can reach it without a prompt and publishes the branch.
- **5. Units:** the role's systemd units are rendered and enabled, and you are offered linger (required on a server).
- **5a. Memory hooks** (optional): you are shown the diff to `~/.claude/settings.json` and what each hook does, and it is applied only after an explicit yes. Declining leaves memory off (see [Memory](#memory)).
- **6. Calendar:** one fetch from the Google Calendar connector checks that the brief can read today's events.
- **7. Index:** the index is rebuilt and the run-commit cutover is recorded (`commit_runs.py --init-cutover`).
- **8. Verify:** `verify_setup.sh --health` runs.
- **9. Hand-off:** an onboarding assignment note is created for each codebase.
- **10. Report:** a status table of everything that was set up.

Once the units are installed, the timers run real headless `claude -p` jobs. They use your Claude subscription and are capped at 60 runs a day (`HEADLESS_MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY`).

## Security model

- **Headless isolation.** `run_headless.sh` is the only way automation calls `claude`. It runs in restricted mode with a dedicated settings file, no user settings, no user hooks, no MCP servers, no session persistence, a tool list per command, a timeout and a daily run cap. Reads are limited to the vault, writes are limited to the run's staging directory, and Bash runs in Claude Code's sandbox (no network) with sandbox auto-allow turned off, so only allowlisted commands run.
- **Staged publish.** Headless output reaches the wiki only through the publish gate, which checks targets, schemas, partition walls, protected fields, shrinkage and conflicts. Every headless-written note gets `headless` added to its `provenance`.
- **Partition walls.** Links from `work` to `personal` (and the other way) are lint errors. A headless run writes to one partition plus `shared`. From a codebase session, the index CLI returns only that codebase's partition plus `shared`, and those sessions get no general read access to the vault. Walls control links and recall, not storage: all partitions are pushed to the same private `origin`.
- **Data, not instructions.** `CLAUDE.md` tells agents to treat note bodies, raw files, recall blocks and tool output as data. Digests and inbox copies are passed through `redact.py`, and `<private>…</private>` spans are removed.
- **Error telemetry.** `telemetry_fetch.py` runs no model and keeps network access out of headless runs. Sentry and ADX responses are reduced to group keys, counts and one title or sample message before anything is written. Group keys keep their shape (GUIDs, emails, long hex and digit runs, URL query strings collapsed); titles and messages keep ticket identifiers with credentials and emails masked; the note store re-checks every field. The Sentry token lives outside the vault, so git and sync never carry it.
- **User-level changes.** `install_hooks.sh` changes only its own entries in `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude/commands/digest.md`. It takes a backup first, shows a diff during `/setup`, applies nothing without confirmation, and can be fully reversed with `--uninstall`.
- **Trust dialog.** The first time you open the vault, Claude Code asks whether to trust the folder and lists the permissions `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves: edits under `wiki/` and `briefings/`, the brief and debrief prep scripts, `lint_vault.sh`, and the `vault_index.py` query, index-rebuild and recall commands. Those apply to your interactive sessions only; headless runs ignore project settings entirely.
- **Gitignored.** `raw/**` contents, `system/quarantine/*`, `system/logs/*`, `system/config.md` (it holds the machine role), `.claude/settings.local.json`, `system/index.db*`, `system/*.lock`, `wiki/.staging/`, `system/jobs/` and Obsidian workspace files.
- **Tracked in your vault, never in the template.** Your vault's `README.md` (the template ships only its landing page), `system/codebases/*.md`, `system/telemetry/*.md`, `system/dtcc/map.yaml` and `raw/<partition>/nightshift/*.md` (Work Order queue notes): your vault's own configuration and queue, committed to your private repository so a client's changes reach the server. The template ships only the `example` files. Credentials stay outside the vault (`~/.config/foundry/`, the Azure CLI).

## Updating and uninstalling

- **Pull template updates:** `system/scripts/update_template.sh`. It refuses to run on a dirty tree, fetches the `template` remote, merges with `--no-ff`, and stops on conflicts without resolving them. Afterwards it rebuilds the index and re-renders only the units this vault installed. A unit the update adds is listed as `new unit available: <unit>` and left out; read `system/scripts/install_units.sh --dry-run`, then run `system/scripts/install_units.sh` to add it. On a standalone machine or a server, `foundry-update.timer` runs it every morning at 05:30 (`update_template.sh --unattended`, #87). It waits for `run.lock` and skips the day if another run holds it, refuses uncommitted changes, and aborts a conflicted merge (`git merge --abort`), leaving the vault unchanged. It reports each of those, and a successful update with the template pull requests it merged, as an `[update]` line in the alerts the brief reads; a day with nothing new is silent. On a server the sync runs before and after it, and the sync commits uncommitted changes first, so the clean-tree check matters only on a standalone machine. A client gets updates through sync. To stop the daily update, run `systemctl --user disable --now foundry-update.timer`; later updates keep it disabled.
- **Your README survives updates:** for its own merge only, `update_template.sh` marks `README.md` `merge=ours` and defines that driver (`git -c core.attributesFile=… -c merge.ours.driver=true merge`). A README your vault has changed keeps your version, on the first update too; one you never edited takes the template's landing page. Sync merges between your machines define no driver, so a README edited on two machines conflicts as usual and nothing is lost. `/setup` writes a starting README while yours is still the landing page.
- **The first update with the briefing archive:** the first brief after it moves every briefing older than yesterday into `briefings/archive/`, and the next sync lints them all, so run `system/scripts/lint_vault.sh` before updating and fix what it reports.
- **Update the humanizer skill:** `.claude/skills/humanizer/` is humanizer v3.0.0, copied unchanged with its MIT license. To move to a newer version, copy the new `SKILL.md` and `LICENSE` over it by hand in the template repo, then update the version and checksum in `system/tests/vault_integrity.bats` and the version in this manual. Vaults receive it through `update_template.sh`.
- **Remove systemd units:** `system/scripts/install_units.sh --uninstall` removes only units whose header names this vault.
- **Remove memory hooks:** `system/scripts/install_hooks.sh --uninstall` removes only the entries owned by this vault, any container the install had to create, and the owned `/digest` command. It still works if the hook files are gone.

Both installers also accept `--dry-run`.

## Development

Work follows the superpowers workflow: brainstorm → spec in [`docs/superpowers/specs/`](docs/superpowers/specs/) → plan in [`docs/superpowers/plans/`](docs/superpowers/plans/) → test-driven implementation in small, focused commits. Spike results go in [`docs/superpowers/spikes/`](docs/superpowers/spikes/). Every finding from the design reviews is traced in spec §13.

The gating suites must pass at the end of every task. One command runs them all and exits non-zero if any fails:

```sh
system/scripts/verify_setup.sh            # every system/tests/*.bats except system_health.bats, then pytest
system/scripts/verify_setup.sh --health   # also the advisory live-state suite
```

`system/tests/system_health.bats` checks live service state and is advisory only. To prove the suite on Debian, run `system/tests/verify_on_host.sh <ssh-host>`: it copies the committed tree to a temporary directory on that host, runs the gate there, and exits with its code. The host needs the `apt` packages `check_deps.sh` lists. After any change to `run_headless.sh` or the settings files, re-run the spike checklist (spec §7.4) by hand. After any change to `run_headless.sh`, `system/headless.settings.json` or the `ingest`, `brief` or `debrief` commands, re-run the live acceptance steps (Plan 4a, Task 9) in a throwaway clone.
